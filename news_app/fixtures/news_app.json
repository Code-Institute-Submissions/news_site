Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>\r\n<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>",

The latest message was just tough - no love involved.</p>\r\n<p>Ruthless and pragmatic, the Everton boss delivered the ultimatum with the air of a man who would not lose a single second of sleep should he have to sell Barkley, making it clear he questions his long-term commitment because of his apparent reluctance to sign a new deal.</p>\r\n<p>Barkley now faces a dilemma. The boyhood Everton fan seems to believe the grass might be greener elsewhere, perhaps for Champions League football at Tottenham. But would Barkley even get in a Spurs team that already has Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen? Could he risk being a bench-warmer with a World Cup looming and England looking certain to qualify?</p>\r\n<p>For Koeman's part, this unsentimental and single-minded individual clearly believes Barkley has had long enough to decide if he wants to stay at Everton and if he wishes to leave seems perfectly content to show him the door.</p>",

Unlike paintball, airsoft is built around 6mm round BBs made of hard plastic.</p>\r\n<p>Frist and Only Events writes on their site: \"Most airsoft guns fire 6mm plastic pellets (or BBS) at relatively low speeds which are fast enough to feel, but slow enough not to cause serious injury. They can fire the BB's up to ranges of 150ft but are a lot less painful than a paintball when they hit you.</p>\r\n<p>\"Many weapons have both semi and full auto capability and often replicate their real world counterparts in look, feel, cycling action and sometimes weight.

Fed up of rizla? Simply itching to use your last old fiver in a stylish, symbolic way? Why not try rolling some tobacco into it.</p>\r\n<p>Sure, the experience might give you tonsillitis - as my friend once discovered when she smoked an Arriva bus ticket - or worse, but if the craving calls and you find yourself in the middle of a forest with only an old fiver, 30g of Golden Virginia and some extra-slim filters to hand, what else are you gonna do?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Betting on something unrealistic knowing that you're only going to lose a worthless fiver</strong></p>\r\n<p>'Hey, Ben.'</p>\r\n<p>'Yeah, mate.'</p>\r\n<p>'Five pound says that traffic warden across the street collapses form heat stroke in ten seconds.'</p>\r\n<p>'Go on then.'</p>\r\n<p>'Ok. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7...'</p>\r\n<p>'You're a fucking mug, you, mate.'</p>\r\n<p>'8... 9... 10.

What are the <em>odds?</em> What are the odds?'</p>\r\n<p><strong>Put an end to wonky tables</strong></p>\r\n<p>You know the ones. Fold yourself up at least three old five pound notes, slide them in between the short leg of your difficult table and the floor and it's goodbye to one the first world's worst problems.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Convince somebody in the future that your old fiver is a special edition new fiver and sell it for at least &pound;80</strong></p>\r\n<p>Don't act like this isn't a pretty decent idea.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
