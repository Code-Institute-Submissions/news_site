# Django News Site

## What the project does and the need that it fulfills.

Django News Site is my final project for Code Institute's full stack stream which I would also like to to convert into a website in it's own right in future. It is an open source news site that allows contributors to register and add their own news content

## Functionality of the project

### Home page
The home page consist of multiple templates
..1 a Hero
..2 2 headline sections for News and Sport
..3 2 rows of 4 of headlines for Politics and Funny Stories
..4 4 More news sections of latest stories

The hero is chosen by ticking a checkbox on the article an author wishes to be the headline article.
### Category landing pages (e.g. Sport, Politics)
### Shop
### Article pages

Article pages contain a title, an image an intro and a body
They also include 2 sets of of related content boxes, one that displays the latest news stories and one that shows the latest stories for that category
### Article edit forms

## Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based off other code

Project was deployed to Heroku, however I had some issues with django_debug_toolbar when testing locally so I uninstalled the debug toolbar completely from the project
